## 🚀 Introduction

### Why ReinPlayer?

As a developer transitioning fully to Linux, I faced a surprising barrier: my favorite tools weren't available. Two of them kept me tied to Windows:

- Internet Download Manager (IDM)
- PotPlayer

I eventually found a good alternative to IDM, but PotPlayer remained unmatched. Tools like VLC and SMPlayer are powerful, yet they lack the seamless and intuitive experience PotPlayer offers, especially with playlist management.

#### Key Missing Features in Other Players:

- Playlists are saved as files and don't persist between sessions.
- Doesn't auto-load all similar files in a folder when opening a video (e.g., play next episode automatically)
- Must manually open playlist files, unlike PotPlayer's built-in view.
- Doesn't resume playback from the last played video
- Interfaces can feel clunky or unintuitive etc

I decided to build only what I need. **ReinPlayer** captures the essential experience I missed on Linux.

---

## 🛠️ Solutions I Explored

Before building ReinPlayer, I attempted a few alternatives:

- Searched for Linux players with similar playlist behavior.
- Tried installing PotPlayer with Wine.
- Attempted Steam-based installation (unsuccessful due to constant crashes).

## 💡 Why Flutter?

With a background in **Java** and **C#**, you might ask why I chose Flutter over something like Avalonia or JavaFX.

The answer is simple: I plan to build cross-platform mobile apps in the future, and Flutter is my tool of choice. ReinPlayer was a perfect opportunity to deepen my Flutter experience.

## 🧩 Architecture

ReinPlayer follows the **MVVM** architecture along with a hybrid **feature + layered** approach.

- `common` – Shared widgets, logic, helpers.
- `playback` – Playback screen, video/audio controls.
- `playlist` – Album and playlist management.
- `settings` – User preferences and configuration.
- `player_frame` – Window actions (minimize, maximize, fullscreen, etc.)
- `developer` – Developer tools and logs.

## 🎯 Challenges & Future Improvements

### Challenges Overcome

- **Packaging Complexity**: Snap packaging proved challenging due to persistent LXD container issues. Switched to AppImage for a more streamlined distribution approach. 😅

- **Menu Architecture**: Implementing a player menu with unlimited nesting capability required significant effort. While the current implementation supports unlimited depth, there's still room for optimization and refinement.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Successfully added macOS build support alongside existing Linux and Windows support.
- I'm not a professional Flutter developer, so I'm sure there are many things that could be improved.

### Current Challenges

**Code**

- As a personal project, documentation wasn't the primary focus
- Code could benefit from:
  - A lot of refactoring 😂
  - Better documentation of complex logic
  - Clearer naming conventions
  - Additional inline documentation

```bash
sudo snap install --dangerous reinplayer_linux_amd64.snap
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ All dependencies included
- ✅ Sandboxed security
- ✅ Perfect desktop integration
- ✅ No additional setup required

---

### 🥈 Method 2: AppImage (Portable)

**For other installation methods (AppImage, Portable, or Debian), Sometimes, you need to install these dependencies first:**

```bash
# Install required dependencies
sudo apt install zenity libmpv-dev libmpv2

# Create compatibility symlinks (choose one that works for your system)
# Option 1:
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so.2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so.1

# Option 2 (alternative path):
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so /usr/lib/libmpv.so.1
```

**Then run AppImage:**

```bash
chmod +x ReinPlayer-x86_64_v1-0-2.AppImage
./ReinPlayer-x86_64_v1-0-2.AppImage
```

---

### 🥉 Method 3: Debian Package

**Install dependencies first:**

```bash
sudo apt install zenity libmpv-dev libmpv2

# Create compatibility symlinks (choose one that works for your system)
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so.2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so.1
# OR
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so /usr/lib/libmpv.so.1
```

**Then install package:**

```bash
sudo dpkg -i reinplayer_linux_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f  # Fix any dependency issues
```

---

### 🏃 Method 4: Portable Bundle

**Install dependencies first (Linux only):**

```bash
sudo apt install zenity libmpv-dev libmpv2

# Create compatibility symlinks
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so.2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so.1
# OR
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so /usr/lib/libmpv.so.1
```

**Then extract and run:**

```bash
tar -xzf reinplayer_linux_amd64_portable.tar.gz
cd reinplayer_linux_amd64_portable
./rein_player
```

---

### 🗑️ Uninstall

**Snap:**

```bash
sudo snap remove reinplayer
```

**Debian Package:**

```bash
sudo apt remove reinplayer
```

---

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting

1. **Install missing packages (Linux):**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install libmpv2 libmpv-dev zenity
   ```

2. **macOS Security**: If macOS blocks the app, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy and allow the application to run.

**Note:** Snap package users don't need any additional setup - all dependencies are included!
